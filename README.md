# Illini Dancesport Calendar Sync

This is a script to synchronize Illini Dancesport's Google Calendar with the input space request confirmation PDF from Illini Union Event Service.
It parses the PDF, extracts times and locations, and uses Google Calendar API to create or update events.

Please refer to [Google Calendar Python
Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/quickstart/python) for
Authorization setup.
